Workflow
--------

3 files:
	- Input.bpc
	- XML.bp
	- Output.exe

Input.bpc -> XML.bp:
	1. Create a XML code without analyzing program logic and data types, just a syntactical analysis
	2. If there are any imports, append them to the thread queue (they will be compiled later)
	3. After all XML codes have been created do a semantical analysis (correct data types etc.)
	4. If there are no errors write the XML code to the filesystem
